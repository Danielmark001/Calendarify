# Calendarify
Calendarify, building the next-generation productivity platform that uses artificial intelligence to plan your day. By constantly monitoring and reorganizing people's to-do list and calendar, we help NTU students make time for their highest priority tasks, reduce the stress of being overwhelmed by meetings, and make sure deadlines are never missed. Integrated with [Health.AI](https://github.com/Danielmark001/hackathon_wellbeing_application), we developed an application that fosters sleep through Gamification, AI Calendar, and many more. Through this app, it customs your own schedule and gives reminders on important activities for promoting sleep, such as eating nutritious food, taking a stretch and exercise, as well as breaks between study/work schedule.
